    <center><h2>Jones Family Reunion<br />2020 VISIONARY</h2></center>

<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>Spring is almost here and our family reunion is just around the corner. Please, save the dates of <strong>Thursday, July 23 – Sunday, July 26, 2020</strong> to spend with your family. I can’t tell you how excited we are to have everyone coming here to California. We have some fun-filled exciting events planned for everyone. Our events will be headquartered in beautiful <strong>Long Beach, CA</strong>.</p>

<p>Pack your bags and make those reservations to come spend some time with us out by the beach. You don’t want to miss this reunion as it will go down in history! We have come a long way since starting back in Hughes, Arkansas in 1993. We’ve been to Memphis, Dallas, Buffalo, Little Rock, Pine Bluff, St. Louis, and this will be second time in Los Angeles. We can wait to see all of you. You can bring friends and in-laws too, it just won’t be the same if we don’t see all of you.</p>

<p>We are kicking off the festivities with a Meet and Greet event on Thursday evening which will be at our host hotel Hampton Inn / Homewood Suites by Hilton at Long Beach Airport. This will be where you complete your check-in and registration for the reunion and get all the pertinent information. Please reserve your room as soon as possible as this will be a very busy travel time during the summer and rooms may be limited.</p>

<p>We want everyone to come and be comfortable, talk about old times, when we were all younger. Exchange some of those old folklore stories that Grandma and Papa use to tell us. Share recipes, nobody could make fried chicken like auntie. Find out what cousin Carolyn really puts in that famous cake of hers. Family just isn’t family without you. Don’t miss all the fun and excitement!</p>

<p>Please send in your registration form even if you are not attending. This will enable us to keep you in the loop for future events and to stay in touch throughout the year. It will also help us to develop a family directory.</p>

<p>The hotel does provide a complimentary breakfast each morning in the Loge. There are also many eateries and shopping just across the parking lot from the hotel. It is also close in proximity to several major malls and large shopping areas.</p>

<p>Can’t wait to see you! Ya’ll come now ya here!</p>

    <h3>Flights to Long Beach</h3>

    <p>It is suggested that you fly into and out of Long Beach Airport (<strong>LGB</strong>). Long Beach receives service from American, Delta, Southwest, Jet Blue, Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines. Long Beach is a much smaller airport than LAX, thus the crowds are far smaller with less traffic. The hassles of security check points are also far more convenient than those of LAX. There is a complementary shuttle provided by the hotel to and from the airport. Other nearby airports include John Wayne (<strong>SNA</strong>)(Santa Anna) [less traffic than LAX], Los Angeles International (<strong>LAX</strong>), and Ontario International Airport (<strong>ONT</strong>).</p>  

    <p>Can’t wait to see you, let’s get those wheels to turning!</p>
